Reaction Paper to Alan Turing's Computing Machinery and Intelligence

The book titled "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" talks about the question of whether machines could think like humans. I also asked this question to myself since I started to use computers when I was a child, 
like how machines could compute a large number in just a second. In his book, he introduced a game called the imitation game, where a machine could act or behave like a human to make us think that it is a human, 
and I found it interesting and revolutionary because we can train or teach the machines basic instructions in order to adapt and learn, like how we teach the children to learn about things in life and improve themselves over time. 
It is amazing to see that in modern technology nowadays we live in an IT era where most of the tasks are automated and systems, software, or applications on our devices could adapt to our daily routine, 
like in just one command they could do and accomplish the tasks without supervision, and it simply tells that artificial intelligence and machine learning also progress and learn through the years. 
Lastly, this book gave me a thought: if a machine could think on its own, some would say it was dangerous because in movies like Terminator, where AI and robots overwhelm the humans, but just like Alan Turing, 
I found technology to be helpful to humans, like on the brighter side they could help us to be productive in our tasks and also we can learn from them like improving our critical thinking, creativity, and innovation, which could lead us to a better future.
